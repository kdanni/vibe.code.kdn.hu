## Requirements
- Functional expectations
- Inputs/outputs and validation

- Artifacts or screenshots to capture in `/results`

## Tooling and Constraints
- Preferred languages/runtimes (default: Python 3.11+)
- Allowed/avoided frameworks and dependencies
- Execution environment notes

## Sample Flow (optional)
Walk through a quick example run or user interaction to ground the intent.
