# Vibe Requirements Engineering

This document outlines the Vibe Requirements Engineering process.

## Process Overview

The Vibe Requirements Engineering process is a workflow for refining high-level requirements into actionable user stories with the assistance of Agentic AI.

1.  **Top Level Requirement**: A high-level goal or requirement is identified and captured.
2.  **Refinement**: Agentic AI analyzes the top-level requirement, asks clarifying questions (if configured), and breaks it down into detailed sub-requirements.
3.  **Use Case / User Story Generation**: The refined requirements are converted into specific use cases and user stories for implementation.

## Directory Hierarchy

The requirements are organized into the following directory structure to represent the flow of the process:

-   `1_top_level/`: Stores the initial, high-level requirements.
    -   Example: `req_001_do_something.md`
-   `2_refined/`: Stores the detailed sub-requirements generated by the refinement process.
-   `3_user_stories/`: Stores the final use cases and user stories ready for development.

## Example

**Top Requirement**:
> Do something.

This requirement would be placed in `1_top_level/req_001_do_something.md`.
