# Results

Use this folder to capture proof that each slop artifact runs and matches the vibe. Pair every prompt/slop contribution with a short result file or screenshot reference.

## Result template
Copy `result_template.md` to start a new entry (rename to match the prompt ID).

```markdown
# <Prompt ID>: Result Summary

## Run context
- Date/runner:

- Command used:

## Outcome
- What happened when the artifact ran?
